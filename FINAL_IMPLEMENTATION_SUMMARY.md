#### 3. **Configure Environment**
Update `.env.local`:
```env
# Airtable
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AIRTABLE_API_TOKEN=patXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Image Hosting (choose one)
IMGBB_API_KEY=your_imgbb_api_key
# OR
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

#### 4. **Test Integration**
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the creator form
3. Fill out form and upload test images
4. Submit and verify data appears in Airtable with proper image attachments

#### **Security Features:**
- Environment variables properly configured
- API tokens with minimal required permissions
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling without exposing sensitive data

#### **Performance Optimizations:**
- Image compression before upload
