# Debug Instructions for Booking Form

## Issue: No Terminal Logs Appearing

The fact that you're not seeing any logs in the terminal means the API route `/api/booking/airtable` is not being called at all. This indicates a **frontend issue**, not a backend issue.

## Quick Debug Steps

### 1. **Check Browser Console First**
1. Open your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Try submitting the booking form
5. Look for any JavaScript errors or console logs

### 2. **Check Network Tab**
1. In Developer Tools, go to the **Network** tab
2. Try submitting the booking form
3. Look for any HTTP requests to `/api/booking/airtable`
4. If you don't see the request, the form isn't submitting properly

### 3. **Test the API Directly**
I've created a test API route. Try this in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/test-booking
```

Or test with curl:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-booking \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

### 4. **Check if Form is Rendering**
1. Go to a creator's detail page
2. Click "Book This Creator"
3. Check if the form opens
4. Try filling out the form and submitting

## Possible Issues

### A. **Form Not Submitting**
- JavaScript errors preventing form submission
- Event handler not attached properly
- Form validation failing silently

### B. **Wrong API Endpoint**
- Form might be calling wrong URL
- Typo in fetch URL
- CORS issues

### C. **Component Not Updated**
- The updated BookingForm component might not be in use
- Old version still being used

## Quick Fix Test

Add this simple test to see if the form is working:

1. **Open the booking form**
2. **Open browser console (F12)**
3. **Fill out the form with test data:**
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Project Type: Custom Commission
   - Description: Test booking request

4. **Click Submit**
5. **Check console for any logs starting with:**
   - `🎯 BookingForm:`
   - `🔄 BookingForm:`
   - `🌐 BookingForm:`

## Expected Console Output

If the form is working, you should see:
```
🎯 BookingForm: Component rendered
🔄 BookingForm: Form submitted
📝 BookingForm: Form data: {...}
🌐 BookingForm: Making API call to /api/booking/airtable
📡 BookingForm: API response status: 200
```

## If No Console Logs Appear

This means the BookingForm component is not using the updated code. The form is still using the old simulated API call.

## Next Steps

1. **Check browser console first**
2. **Report what you see in the console**
3. **Check if you see any network requests**
4. **Let me know if the form opens at all**

This will help me identify exactly where the issue is occurring!
