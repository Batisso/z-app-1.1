# ✅ Updated Airtable Integration - Separate Fields

## 🎯 What's Changed

Your creator form has been updated to store each field separately in Airtable instead of combining them into a single "Creator Info" text field. This provides much better data structure and usability.

## 📊 New Airtable Table Structure

### **Updated "Creator Applications" Table Fields:**

| Field Name | Field Type | Description | Example |
|------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Single line text | Creator's full name | "John Doe" |
| **Email** | Email | Creator's email address | "john.doe@example.com" |
| **Country of Origin** | Single line text | Where the creator is from | "United States" |
| **Currently Based In** | Single line text | Where the creator currently lives | "Canada" |
| **Bio** | Long text | Creator's biography and description | "I'm a passionate photographer..." |
| **Portfolio Images** | Attachment | Up to 12 portfolio images | [Image files] |
| **Submission Date** | Date & time | Auto-generated timestamp | "2024-01-15 14:30:00" |
| **Status** | Single select | Application status | "Pending Review" |
| **Notes** | Long text | Internal notes (optional) | "Great portfolio!" |

## 🔄 Migration from Old Structure

### **If you already have the old "Creator Info" field:**

1. **Keep the old data** - Don't delete existing records
2. **Add the new fields** to your Airtable table:
   - Name (Single line text)
   - Email (Email)
   - Country of Origin (Single line text)
   - Currently Based In (Single line text)
   - Bio (Long text)
3. **New submissions** will use the separate fields
4. **Old submissions** will still have the combined "Creator Info" field

### **For a fresh start:**

1. **Create a new table** called "Creator Applications"
2. **Add all the fields** listed above
3. **Skip the old "Creator Info" field** entirely
